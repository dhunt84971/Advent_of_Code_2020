# Advent_of_Code_2020

My solutions to the Advent of Code for 2020.

**WARNING!!!** Don't open these if you plan on participating unless you have already completed the specific challenge.  Otherwise you will not be able to experience the joy of developing your own unique solution.

I'm doing these in JS for now.  Mostly because I only have limited time and am primarily coding in JS at the moment.

## NodeJS
Just to clarify, these solutions are written in JS, but use nodeJS so the necessary libraries required for direct file access and execution without a browser are available.

For example, once nodeJS is installed on the development PC executing a javascript file is as simple as:
```
node Puzzle1.js
```
To send output to the console, just use ```console.log("[your output]");``` as usual.
