# Advent_of_Code_2020

My solutions to the Advent of Code for 2020.

**WARNING!!!** Don't open these if you plan on participating unless you have already completed the specific challenge.  Otherwise you will not be able to experience the joy of developing your own unique solution.

I'm doing these in JS for now.  Mostly because I only have limited time and am primarily coding in JS at the moment.
